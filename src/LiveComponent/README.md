# Live Components

**EXPERIMENTAL** This component is currently experimental and is
likely to change, or even change drastically.

Live components work with the [TwigComponent](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html)
library to give you the power to automatically update your
Twig components on the frontend as the user interacts with them.
Inspired by [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and
[Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html).
