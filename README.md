    Symfony UX: a new JavaScript ecosystem for Symfony
</h3>

Since its creation, JavaScript has always been focused on creating innovative User
Experiences. It lets developers create the **most intuitive and usable** User
Experience possible for a specific problem.

In practice however, building great User Experiences with JavaScript is difficult.
It takes time to choose reliable packages, to configure them, to integrate them
in your pages, and to make your front-end code interact with the rest of your
infrastructure.

This problem is not new: it looks a whole lot like the state of Symfony in PHP
before Symfony Flex. We need a Symfony Flex equivalent for JavaScript: a tool to
build amazing User Experiences as quickly as we can now setup
[an HTTP client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html), 
[a Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html) or 
[an administration panel](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/index.html).

**That's Symfony UX.**

# Let's build an amazing ecosystem together

Symfony UX is an **initiative**: its aim is to build an ecosystem. To achieve this,
we need your help: what other packages could we create in Symfony UX? What about a 
library that automatically adds an [input mask](https://imask.js.org/) to the text 
fields of your Symfony forms? Or the ability to make the `EntityType` render with
[AJAX auto-completion](https://tarekraafat.github.io/autoComplete.js)? Anything you 
do in JavaScript could be done streamlined as a UX package.

We have some ideas and we will release more packages in the coming days. The rest
is on you: let's create an amazing ecosystem together!
